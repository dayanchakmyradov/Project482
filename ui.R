                   is one of the most widely recognized and used biosignals in the medical field. Heart rates per minute (bpm)
                   can be easily calculated by counting the R-wave peaks of the ECG  during 1 minute of recording. More importantly,
                   the rhythm and shape of the ECG waveform is altered in conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cardiac arrhythmias."
